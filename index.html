                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <h1>Making Disciples of all Nations</h1>
                <p> The New Covenant Church started
                    in October 1985 with the first worship venue at
                    the Women Training Centre, Samonda, in
                    Ibadan, Nigeria.  In 1986, the first centre in the
                    United Kingdom started at Elephant and
                    Castle, London.  We presently have over 500 
                    branches of the Church in Africa, Europe,
                    America, Middle East and Asia.  Over 400 of the
                    branches are located in Nigeria</p>

        <h3>MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
        <p>To bring every member into maturity in Christ.
            To foster deep and meaningful fellowship.
            To encourage and work for unity among all believers.
            To work for the good of the Community.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-us gray slide-in fade-in">
        <h3>DISCIPLESHIP</h3>
        <p>In the Great Commission, our Lord commands us
            to “make disciples of all nations”.  To realistically
            evangelize the world every believer must be equipped
            and empowered to win souls and bring them to maturity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-us purple slide-in fade-in">
        <h3>BIBLICAL</h3>
        <p>A return to the original pattern of the church entails engaging
            only in biblical teaching and practices, especially as expounded 
            in the New Testament by Jesus Christ Himself in the Gospels, and 
            by the Apostles in the Epistles.  If Jesus is the Founder and Head 
            of the Church, then the Church needs to preach, teach and practise 
            only what He (Jesus) taught.</p>
